# Overwatch Rank Reporter

This is a very minimal codebase to report on going the rank of a few players (friends)
to a graphite backend.

## Goal

There is no way at the moment in Overwatch to view the amount you *gain* / *lose* between
games, which is frustrating.

It is useful to learn for instance:
1. Is there a win streak bonus?
2. Is there a loss bonus?
3. What hour of the day are you getting the largest win results?
4. How rank vs. rank loss/win differential looks like.
